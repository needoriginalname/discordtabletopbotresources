It is extremely potent, and had it not been for its fluidity, it would be extremely hard to keep down. If spilled, you must make a Dexterity DC10 Saving Throw to not slip on the tile it was dropped on or fall prone.",
			"n": 50
		}, {
			"desc": "Dwarven Tomb: Also called a Pondahl Tafone by elitists who don't want to sound like a ruffian when they order it, this drink is a dwarven-made black mead. Besides its blackcurrants, it has a very earthy flavor and a grit to it. While someone who calls it a Pondhal Tafone would likely explain to you in depth that the earthy flavor and grittiness comes from a complicated and sophisticated fermenting process involving fresh roots that only a trained pallette can detect, the validity of this claim could be brought into question as the beverage is traditionally served in an unhewn stone cup. Something which those who call it a Dwarven Tomb, spare no time in pointing out, much to the frustration of their well dressed counterparts who are often mid-explanation.",

		}, {
			"desc": "The Princess: A reddish spirit with a fruity taste. Because of the sweetness, the colour and that is sometimes served with some flower inside the glass, some people may think of it as weak, but is extremely potent and usually a few glasses are enough to wake up the morning after with no recollection of what happened.",
			"n": 59
		}, {

			"n": 64
		}, {
			"desc": "The Walking Red: A unassuming dry red wine that the players are instructed to 'let breathe,' for a while before consumption. The longer the player lets it sit, the more it seems to actually be breathing. If left long enough, it will crawl out of the mug and wander away.",

This lively cousin of the Gelatinous Cube dances wildly in its bottle when it is given a little shake, as if it is sloshed itself. Sometimes brewers add flecks of precious metals like gold simply for visual effect and conspicuous extravagance. Typically served in a shot glass, the gelatinous drink goes down with a slightly paralyzing effect giving the drinker a signature raspy lisp. It is sweet from the molasses half-metabolized into alcohol (yes, it's technically a rum) and flavored by other organic material added in the brewing process\u2014berries are popular, but some adventurous combinations include ghost peppers, whole octopi and cilantro. Left too long on its own, it has been known to sneak out of the glass and crawl off a bar.",
