After spending many years living among the dwarves, Weatherbee made his way home with a drink even the stout folk couldn\u2019t handle. This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like \u201cA kick in the face from a horse.\u201d After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze. The nature of these effects is up to either the DM or the player, so long as the effects are sufficiently insignificant. After 1d4 hours, the haze drops away and the drinker immediately and almost violently falls into a deep sleep so that they may recover.",
