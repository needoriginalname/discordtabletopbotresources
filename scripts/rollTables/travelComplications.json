		}, {
			"n": 14,
			"desc": "While passing through an abandoned farm, you come across a scarecrow that psychically whispers to you. It gives the party an 'impossible' riddle and claims that if you cannot answer then it will not let you pass.

		}, {
			"n": 26,

		}, {
			"n": 32,
			"desc": "An 8-year old boy is peacefully leading a giant pit fiend/ Manticore/ Purple Worm on a chain behind him down the road. If asked about it, he laughs and says, 'oh, that's our cow. She just likes to play tricks on strangers.' He then ruffles the- whatever- and continues on his way whistling."
		}, {
			"n": 33,
			"desc": "Your map failed to mention a road inn halfway to your destination. The inn is completely empty with the door torn off it's hinges. With a local knowledge/geography check you know that this inn shouldn't even be here, this was once the location of a grave site."

		}, {
			"n": 37,
			"desc": "A great human knight has just died of a heart attack as he travelled down the road. His squire and page have pulled him to the side, and one has gone to fetch help. The knight has powerful magical armor and weaponry which would fetch a pretty penny, and there are robbers about..."
		}, {

		}, {
			"n": 41,
			"desc": "As you make your way along the road, you come across a rotting dead animal carcass. The smell is horrid, but it is nothing out of the ordinary. As you continue, a few more animal carcasses are strewn across the road. More and more bodies begin to appear along the road the further you go. You eventually come face to face with a 20ft wall stacked full of bodies ranging from livestock, predatory animals, and even people. The wall blocks the road, and the only ways to proceed include scaling a nearby muddied-with-blood slope, backtracking to find another route, or digging through."

		}, {
			"n": 44,
			"desc": "Flash Flood: A downpour upstream has triggered a flash flood over a low part of the road. Although the water is 3 feet deep, the current is so swift that it will without fail sweep away anyone trying to ford it. Individuals swept away face the risks of bludgeoning, impalement on debris, and drowning. By stepping in it at the shallower edge, it is obvious to even survival novices that it will be extremely dangerous to cross, especially towards the middle. The party can choose to wait it out if they like although it will take a long while."
		}, {
			"n": 45,
			"desc": "Stampede: A large herd of bison/gnus has been spooked and is wildly stampeding down the road as it is the path of least resistance. Get out of the way or be trampled."

		}, {
			"n": 51,
			"desc": "After walking for a good few miles along the path down the clear road, you reach an invisible barrier. Then the illusion breaks - this Mirage Arcane made this deep cave look like a clear plains with a nice lovely stone path identical to the one you've been following. You are half a mile into this cave, and the fey who have lured you here do NOT want you to leave without doing something for them first."
		}, {
			"n": 52,
			"desc": "Modrons: Along the path you find a group of modrons (2 monodrones and a duodrone). These modrons were not given the return order during the last modron march (due to complications from becoming attacked) and are still trying to collect data. Upon noticing the party they harass them for data, doing things like surveying them and mesuring the size of their clothes while they are walking. They continue to do this until they either lose sight of the party or are destroyed."
		}, {
			"n": 53,
			"desc": "A fire can be seen just under a mile away in an obviously cultivated field, the wind now blows billows of smoke over the road the party is crossing.

		}, {
			"n": 58,
			"desc": "Everyone the party asked in the last town/village/waypoint has said the only safe way to get through the valley is to take the blue path, detailed and maintained by both of the communities it is flanked by. The villagers all said the upkeep was mutual, and that they were on very good terms with the other town/village/waypoint."
		}, {
			"n": 59,
			"desc": "Upon getting out of the first town's territory, they find the rest of the path barricaded and blocked, the barricade older and written in an archaic version of the prime language. The trees and animals all look like they are from a different time. There is a 'detour' path but it's filled with primeval dangers."
		}, {
			"n": 60,

		}, {
			"n": 62,
			"desc": "A massive and extremely powerful dragon ambushes you somewhere along your journey through a massively dense and vast forest.  It is strong enough to slaughter you all without trying, and is upset that you are not aware of it.  Gonna have to talk fast to appease it.  It also desires a rare food item you possess, and will allow you to pass if you offer it the food and an appeal to its vanity."

		}, {
			"n": 64,
			"desc": "There's been an earthquake, and the pathway is blocked by something. It might be a fallen tree, a crack in the ground, or a piece of land that broke off a mountainside. Either way, it's going to be difficult to get past it and nigh-impossible to get a cart across."

Along the sides of the road are statues of confused, frightened animals made from random rocks and minerals. All organic life in the area slowly begins transforming into various rocks and minerals over the course of one full day, at which point the organisms are petrified. A fully transformed organism may only be cured through use of Greater Restoration or a similarly powerful magical effect.
